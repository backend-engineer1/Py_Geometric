- Added `CHANGELOG.md` ([#4581](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/pull/4581))
### Changed
- Refactored reading molecular positions from sdf file for qm9 datasets ([4654](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/pull/4654))
- Fixed `MLP.jittable()` bug in case `return_emb=True` ([#4645](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/pull/4645), [#4648](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/pull/4648))
- The generated node features of `StochasticBlockModelDataset` are now ordered with respect to their labels ([#4617](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/pull/4617))
- Removed unnecessary colons and fixed typos in the documentation ([#4616](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/pull/4616))
- The `bias` argument in `TAGConv` is now actually applied ([#4597](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/pull/4597))
- Fixed subclass behaviour of `process` and `download` in `Datsaet` ([#4586](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/pull/4586))
